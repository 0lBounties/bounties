# bounties


## Overview

This repository is for the [Hustle Karma](https://handbook.0l.network/index.php?title=Hustle_Karma) Working Group that operates on the [0L Network](https://0l.network/). The source of truth for the different working groups missions is the [Hustle Karma Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrCuXWvrZgHkspk7/tblixhNzkEaKt3a75). This repository acts as a conduit to allow these missions to be displayed on [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) by having a place to store bounties as github [issues](https://github.com/0lBounties/bounties/issues).

## About 0L

0L is a new Layer 1 blockchain protocol. 0L is open, permissionless, and community governed. Inspired by Satoshi, and informed by experience, 0L combines state of the art blockchain technology with truly decentralized governance. There is no foundation, no corporate backers, no venture capital firms. This is a community-driven project with a meaningful commitment to social impact and democratic decision-making. If you are looking for a blockchain that does things differently, with priorities that reflect your values, join 0L and help us realize the transformative power of decentralized architecture free from corporate agendas. 


## Contribute

0L is a community-driven project, therefore you will find multiple areas where you can engage with the project. While there is always development work to be done, there is also a wide variety of interesting non-technical work that needs to be done. Specific projects the community has prioritized are often supported by bounty payments. The process of matching workers with tasks is what we call Hustle Karma. If you are interested in that type of engagement, please visit [ðŸ› ï½œhustle-karma](https://discord.gg/wqdnrBZX) and introduce yourself and tell us a bit about what you'd like to do. 

Additionally, we manage community projects and coordinate work via our working groups.
