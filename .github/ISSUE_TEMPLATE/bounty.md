**DISCLAIMER:** This issue is NOT funded by cUSD, It is funded by 0L GAS, the native token for the 0L Network. The 0L GAS token is currently not liquid -- and may never be -- although, it is possible that it will at some point become available via a DEX through community development initiatives.

**ABOUT 0L:** 0L is a new Layer 1 blockchain protocol. 0L is open, permissionless, and community governed. Inspired by Satoshi, and informed by experience, 0L combines state-of-the-art blockchain technology with truly decentralized governance. The technology stack is built on Rust and employs the Move smart contracting language. The protocol includes an innovative Sybil protection mechanism (Delay Towers). There is no foundation, no corporate backers, no venture capital firms. This is a community-driven project with a meaningful commitment to social impact and democratic decision-making. It is based upon the Diem/Move ecosystem. More information regarding economic incentives and roadmap can be found at the [0L Website](https://0l.network/) and [0L Discord](https://discord.gg/fb8UEBS6)
